# Missile Script

A simple game to show people the broad overview of Naval anti-ship missile defence.

## Usage

Elixir is required to run the program.

As long as it has execute permissions it can be run as a command line script, or
run with the Elixir interpreter:

```shell
# Run as command line script
./missile_script.exs

# Run with Elixir interpreter
elixir missile_script.exs
```
